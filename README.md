## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [No] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [No] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

This was my first time working with Swift and iOS development. I faced difficulties with the Swift syntax. However, I read through some documentation 
and watched videos that really helped me understand and develop this simple program in Swift.
